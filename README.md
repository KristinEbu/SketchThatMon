A fun drawing game where you sketch random Pokémon from memory!

Customize your experience with adjustable rounds, skips, and timers. You'll be shown a random Pokémon name, and you can skip it if you want a different one. When you're done drawing (or time runs out) the official sprite is revealed so you can compare your sketch with the real deal!
