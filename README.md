# SketchThatMon (WORK IN PROGRESS)

GOAL: A fun drawing game where you sketch random Pok√©mon from memory. Customize timers, rounds, skips, filters, and AI judging. Draw on the built-in canvas or your own device. Save games to the Poke Gallery (10-game limit, oldest auto-deleted).

[FIGMA PROTOTYPE](https://www.figma.com/proto/VHLeFhAbwOXMT5et8pKkPF/SketchThatMon?node-id=36-295&p=f&t=3zacq7E6wB07fAtw-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=3%3A141&starting-point-node-id=36%3A295)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
